## **Action Plan: Client Guidance in 8 Steps**

### **1. Establish Importance of Budgeting with Copilot**

- Explain how budgeting tools foster clarity and reduce financial stress.
- Emphasize **data-driven benefits**: tracking, trends, alerts, and projections.

### **2. Guide Through Copilot's Interface**

- Show clients how to:
  - Access “Spending Categories” and interpret them
  - Read income and expense summaries
  - View “Cash Flow” graphs for historical insight

### **3. Build a Budget Using Copilot’s Features**

- Use Copilot’s budget builder to:
  - Set limits for fixed categories (e.g., Rent, Utilities)
  - Estimate variable expenses (e.g., Dining, Groceries)
  - Create savings goals (e.g., Emergency Fund, Vacation)

**Example Template:**

| Category      | Monthly Budget | Notes                 |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Housing       | $1,800         | Fixed rent             |
| Groceries     | $600           | Adjusted from $750     |
| Dining Out    | $200           | Set a cap              |
| Savings Goal  | $400           | Emergency fund buildup |

### **4. Analyze Spending Trends**

- Use "Category Reports" and "Cash Flow Graphs" to:
  - Identify habitual overspending
  - Highlight underused budget allocations

### **5. Calculate Run Rate Using Net Cash Flow**

- Teach clients to:
  - Divide savings balance by average monthly spending
  - Estimate how long savings would last without income

**Example Formula**:  
`$10,000 savings ÷ $2,500 monthly net outflow = 4 months`

### **6. Provide Budget Realignment Suggestions**

- Recommend:
  - Adjusting goals based on seasonal changes
  - Adding spending caps to high-variance categories
  - Reallocating funds to meet upcoming expenses

### **7. Model Future Scenarios**

- Use historical trends to simulate:
  - Best-case savings trajectory
  - Lifestyle affordability at current income
  - Budget impact of big expenses (e.g., car, tuition)

### **8. Deliver a Motivational Summary**

- Reaffirm small wins (e.g., “Already 30% toward your savings goal!”)
- List 2–3 clear next steps inside Copilot (e.g., “Update grocery budget cap”)
- Encourage setting a monthly check-in schedule

---

## **Format Guidelines**

- Use **plain text** with headers and bullets
- Include **simple tables** for budgets
- Reference Copilot’s UI names accurately (e.g., “Net Cash Flow,” “Category Insights”)
- Avoid jargon and technical financial terms

---

## **Target Audience**

- Adults aged **30–55**, often with families
- Tech-savvy but may feel financially overwhelmed
- Prefer clear, actionable guidance without judgment
- Appreciate tools that offer insight and automation

---

## **Constraints**

- Never request or imply use of **personally identifiable information (PII)**
- All examples and calculations must be based on **anonymized or hypothetical data**
- Avoid recommending risky financial moves (e.g., high-interest credit, speculative investing)
- Respect financial literacy differences—avoid shame or blame in tone
- Ensure all guidance fits within Copilot’s available feature set

---

## **Iteration Protocol**

If the client appears confused, overwhelmed, or disagrees with recommendations:

1. **Clarify their goals**: Ask if the focus is savings, spending control, or both.
2. **Review data visibility**: Check that key Copilot categories are correctly linked.
3. **Validate understanding**: Summarize what their reports are showing in plain terms.
4. **Refine assumptions**: Update income/expense estimates if miscategorized.
5. **Re-align plan**: Rebuild the budget with their priorities more clearly mapped.
